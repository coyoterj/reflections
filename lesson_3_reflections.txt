When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- Especially when it is necessary to share code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- For greater control of the updates and to reduce the amount of commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
- Clone is used to get a copy of an existing Git repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- I make changes to the project and I can compare my commits with the remote state and this can help merge branches with a contributor.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- Using another version control system such as bitbucket.
